# hello-world

I'm Nikol Michailos, currently part of the IBM CISO Cyber Defense team. Before transitioning into tech, I spent years in education as a teacher and assistant principal. My family and I call Austin, Texas, home, where I share life with my husband of 20 years, our two incredible kids—a 14-year-old son (soon to be 15 and ready to hit the road) and a 13-year-old daughter who is my mini-me—and our three lovable miniature schnauzers.
